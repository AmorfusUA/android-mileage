	<string name="help_title_import_export">Import/Export Help</string>
	<string name="help_import_db_title">Import SQLite</string>
	<string name="help_import_db">When importing SQLite databases it is extremely important to know that it will overwrite your current database.
	All local changes will be lost forever. The file that will be imported needs to be on your SD card as "mileage.db"</string>
	<string name="help_import_csv_title">Import CSV</string>
	<string name="help_import_csv">Importing comma-separated value (CSV) files is useful for providing spreadsheet integration. Note that the format
	is pretty specific; if you are not sure of the format, it's highly recommended that you export a CSV, open it in Excel, insert your values, and
	then import the resulting spreadsheet. Note that the input file needs to be on your SD card as "mileage.csv". Dates need to be in milliseconds 
	since 1/1/1970.</string>
	<string name="help_import_sql_title">Import SQL</string>
	<string name="help_import_sql">Importing SQL is highly dependent on the database schema. If you do not know what you're doing with this, it is
	recommended you use another option. The file that is imported needs to be on your SD card as "mileage.sql"</string>
	<string name="help_export_db_title">Export DB</string>
	<string name="help_export_db">Exporting the SQLite database will create a direct copy of your current SQLite database and place the resulting
	copy on your SD card in the file "mileage.db"</string>
	<string name="help_export_csv_title">Export CSV</string>
	<string name="help_export_csv">Exporting a comma-separated value (CSV) file will export your current database into a "mileage.csv" file on
	your SD card. This file can then be used in Excel or any other spreadsheet editor.</string>
	<string name="help_export_sql_title">Export SQL</string>
	<string name="help_export_sql">Exporting your database as SQL will create a "mileage.sql" file on your SD card. These SQL commands can then
	be imported into any other database engine of choice, provided that the schemas match. Note that the table-creation SQL is omitted; it is up
	to the end user to create the necessary tables.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_vehicles">Vehicles Help</string>
	<string name="help_vehicles">From this screen, you can add a new vehicle, or select an existing vehicle to edit. Note that you can long-press on
	a vehicle in the list to bring up a context menu to perform some common operations.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_vehicle_edit">Editing Vehicle Help</string>
	<string name="help_vehicle_edit">From here, you can change attributes about an existing vehicle. If you decide
	to not save your changes, simply press the back button to undo the changes. Note that there must always be at least one vehicle, so you
	can not delete the last vehicle. If you have multiple vehicles, you can choose to set this vehicle as default, so that it is always first
	in the list.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_vehicle_add">Adding Vehicle Help</string>
	<string name="help_vehicle_add">This allows you to add new vehicles to your database. This may be helpful if you drive two vehicles, or
	multiple vehicles share a database. You can optionally set this vehicle to be the default vehicle.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_fillup_new">Recording Fill-Up Help</string>
	<string name="help_fillup_new">You can add incremental fill-ups (since the previous one) by prefixing your odometer with a '+'.
	For example, if you have gone 300 miles since your last fillup, enter '+300'. In portait mode, an on-screen keyboard will appear for making
	quick edits. Note that this keyboard is numeric only.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_history">History Help</string>
	<string name="help_history">The history browser lets you view a list of past fill-ups, of all vehicles. Once a fill-up is selected, you can edit or
	delete individual entries. If the economy is in red, then it is below your average economy value. Green indicates a value above your average 
	economy value. Additionally, you can import or export data. Blue means that it is the same as your average fuel economy.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_fillup_edit">Editing Fill-Up Help</string>
	<string name="help_fillup_edit">From here, you can edit a previously-recorded fill-up, or delete it altogether. Press the back button to undo
	any changes you have made and return to the history browser. You can fill in an optional comment, if you want to.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_settings">Settings Help</string>
	<string name="help_settings">From this screen, you can set preferences to fit your usage. The Orientation setting determines when the UI should rotate.
	A setting of 'device' means that it will rotate when you rotate the device, whereas 'keyboard' will rotate when you open the keyboard tray.</string>
	
	<string name="help_title_statistics">Statistics Help</string>
	<string name="help_statistics">This screen shows a wide range of calculated statistics on a per-vehicle basis. If you have multiple vehicles,
	a drop-down will show, and you can switch between vehicles. Note that statistics can not be calculated on vehicles that don't have enough
	data stored, so you'll get a warning about that.</string>
	
	<string name="help_charts">The charting buttons display graphs of various statistics, usually over time. These open in a browser and the resulting
	image can then be saved, e-mailed, or whatever else you want to do. The divider between the two sections represents the average value.</string>
